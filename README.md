# Proposed Grading based on Rubric

## Functionality
### 4
I Implemented encrypt, decrypt, and crack with command line interface as well as a smart-crack that will crack a message without a key or date(method is unable to return date or key in this case)

## Version Control
### 3
Met number of branches and commits. Often as I'm writing something I realize I need to implement a different piece of functionality. I then implement that and commit. Very few, if any, commits have multiple pieces of functionality. Many commits have one piece of functionality and the code that led up to to realization that piece of functionality was needed. This made more sense to me than deleting code I'd already written just to put it back in. Git push origin master was occassionally used for minor fixes such as whitespace removal or line insertion and once because things were broken and I wasnt sure why but the internet told me it would fix my problem. I feel this is defensible as I was not benefitting from the peer review and discussion of feature branching as it was a solo project.

## Test Driven Development
### 3
Simple coverage is 100%. Stubs for time are implemented to avoid resetting test daily. Tests are not written outside of interaction pattern

## Object Oriented Programming
### 3
Enigma class may have too much logic in itself. Smart-crack is a monster but also in addition to specs. Outside smartcrack 2 methods have > 7 lines if semicolons are prohibited, else project meets criteria for 4 here.
